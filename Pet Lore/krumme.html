        <h1>Krumme</h1>
        <p>
            Krumme, is a Dog from Denmark. He is currently on <a href="dia.html">The D.I.A</a>s most wanted list.
            He is one of the most notorious drug dealers in the world, and is cooperating with The Dog Cartel.
            Not much is currently known about him, other than basic information.
        </p>
         <h3>Childhood</h3>
         <p>
            Krumme was born in the March of 2012. He has 3 brothers, and one sister.
             His father is unknown, and his mother is named <a href="cookie.html">"Cookie"</a>
             When Krumme was a puppy, he was actually not aggresive, and always just looked
            while his siblings were play-fighting, but that all changed when he got older.
            </p>
            <h3>Criminal Activities</h3>
            <p>
                He moved out when he was only 1Â½, where he was in desperate need of money.
                This was also the time where he began taking drugs with his buddies.
                It is unknown how, but Krumme began selling drugs, and he had a good supply,
                and he became so good at dealing, that he began to get on the radar
                of the national dog police. He has only been caught one time, where he was caught
                by an undercover cop, but he fled and he has not been seen in person
                by any authority since. He is currently working with The Dog Cartel,
                which is the reason why he is now wanted by <a href="dia.html">The D.I.A.</a>
