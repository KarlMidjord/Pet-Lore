            The D.I.A (Dog Intelligence Agency), was made to keep track of the most dangerous dog crminals,
            and to try and arrest them. They only work with, and around dogs.
            Since The Great Animal War, all orginizations around law are split from animal
            to animal. there also exists the C.I.A (Cat Intelligence Agency), and a lot of others.

        <h3>Begining</h3>
        <p>
            The D.I.A, started as the A.I.A (Animal Intelligence Agency), where all animals
            shared one, universal Intelligence Agency, but The Great Animal War split it up.
            There are also rumors that the D.I.A was also made to keep track of the other animals,
            but that is not confirmed.
